    1. flexible < inflexible, can fit a function with lots of parameters so can optimize for test accuracy
    2. flexible > inflexible. can't fit a function with too many degrees of liberty
    3. flexible > inflexible. can't make assumptions about the shape of f (as in Y = f(X))
    4. flexible < inflexible?. if there's a lot of noise there's going to be a propensity to overfit, so prob. better to keep your model simple?
