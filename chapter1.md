    1. flexible > inflexible?. can fit a function with lots of parameters so we can optimize for test accuracy. response `f` can be highly non-linear, so better not to make assumptions about its shape (inflexibility)
    2. flexible > inflexible. can't fit a function with too many degrees of liberty
    3. flexible > inflexible. can't make assumptions about the shape of `f` (as in `Y = f(X)`)
    4. flexible < inflexible?. if there's a lot of noise there's going to be a propensity to fit to the noise, so prob. better to keep your model simple?

    1. regression (for CEO salary). this is an inference problem. `n=500`, `p=3`
    2. classification/prediction.  `n=20`, `p=13`
    3. regression. `n=52` weeks, `p=3`
